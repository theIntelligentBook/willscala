# The Adventures of Will Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/theIntelligentBook/willscala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/theIntelligentBook/willscala)

This is an experiment in putting up a public site around one of my courses - teaching Scala, functional programming, and reactive programming to students who have an imperative background (typically, who've taken a Python course and a Java course).

At the university, the course runs inside an LMS, however students frequently request access before the course begins or after it ends (LMS course sites are archived after a time). So, I have an interest in putting materials up in a way in which they can be accessed outside of the study period. Also because I'd like to show that I teach this - university teachers need portfolios too.

It's also part of the Intelligent Book project. Back in my PhD, I worked on ways to make educational materials that understoody what they teach. Explorable explanations, interactions with AI, etc. "Will Scala" does not yet have those components, but is an experiment in seeing how simple it is to take an existing course, put it into a powerful front-end framework, and then augment it over time.

The site is written in Scala.js and auto-depoyed using Travis CI here: [Will Scala](https://theintelligentbook.com/willscala/)

As this one is based on an existing course, once I'm happy the components are stable, I'll also export a JavaScript API from the framework to make it easier for others to build quick public sites from existing course materials.

The art style on the front page for Will Scala is deliberately whimsical. Yes, I drew the sketches. That's because though these are course materials put on the web, it's not quite the same thing as a course. The tutorials are here, but the assessment, the interaction with the class, the interaction with me as a teacher, isn't here. So, to give it a little personality, we have Will Scala (a dreadful pun on "Will Scarlett", one of Robin Hood's merry men), a robot that turns up as an illustration in week 1 and 2, and various other little sketches.
